================================================================================
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS - COMPREHENSIVE
================================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL QUESTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: What exactly is an AI spokesperson?
A: An AI spokesperson is a hyper-realistic digital avatar created using artificial intelligence. It looks, sounds, and moves like a real person, delivering your message naturally. Unlike basic animations or obvious "deep fakes," our spokespersons are virtually indistinguishable from real humans in short-form content. They include natural facial expressions, gestures, breathing patterns, and lip-sync technology.

Q: Is this legal? Are there any concerns I should know about?
A: Absolutely legal! Our AI spokespersons are created using licensed technology and stock footage, or custom-created avatars. You receive full commercial usage rights with your package. We do not use anyone's likeness without proper licensing. For voice cloning, we only clone YOUR voice with your explicit consent.

Q: Will people be able to tell it's AI?
A: In short-form content (under 60 seconds), most viewers cannot tell the difference. The technology has advanced significantly. We optimize for social media viewing where attention spans are short. For longer content, more astute viewers might notice subtle differences, which is why we recommend short-form for most clients.

Q: Can I use these videos for paid advertising?
A: Yes! All videos are delivered ad-ready and you have full commercial usage rights. You can use them for organic posts, paid ads on any platform (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Google), email marketing, website content, sales pages, and any other business purpose.

Q: How is this different from just hiring a spokesperson?
A: Several key advantages:
- Cost: Human spokespersons charge $500-5,000+ per video
- Availability: AI works 24/7, no scheduling conflicts
- Consistency: Same quality every time, no "off days"
- Speed: 30 videos in 7 days vs. weeks of coordination
- Scalability: Easy to produce 30-60+ videos monthly
- Languages: One spokesperson can speak 20+ languages
- Revisions: Easy changes without re-filming
- No egos: No talent management issues

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTENT & VIDEO QUESTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: What topics will you create videos about?
A: We create a strategic mix based on your business:

- Promotional content (services, offers, features)
- Myth-busting (address misconceptions)
- Behind-the-scenes style content
- Industry news and trends
- Seasonal and holiday content
- Engagement-focused content (questions, polls)
- Testimonial-style content
- Case study highlights

Q: Can I request specific video topics?
A: Absolutely! During onboarding, you can provide a list of topics, FAQs, services to highlight, or specific content ideas. We also do competitive research to find content gaps and opportunities. Monthly clients can submit topic requests anytime through the client portal.

Q: What's the ideal video length?
A: Our standard is 20-40 seconds, optimized for social media algorithms. This length has the highest completion rates and engagement. For Authority Engine clients, we also offer longer 2-3 minute videos for YouTube and in-depth content.

A: Yes! All videos include:
- Burned-in captions (hardcoded for silent viewing)

================================================================================
OBJECTION HANDLING
================================================================================

"It's too expensive"
→ I totally understand budget is a consideration! Let me put it in perspective: hiring a videographer, scriptwriter, and spokesperson separately would cost $500-1,000 per video minimum. That's $15,000-30,000 for 30 videos. Our Launch Kit at $1,500 is a fraction of that cost. Plus, you'll have content working for you 24/7, generating leads while you sleep. Many clients see ROI from their first week of posting. Would it help to start with our Launch Kit to test it out?

"I'm not sure AI video is for me"
→ That's a fair concern! Many of our most successful clients felt the same way initially. Here's the thing - our AI spokespersons are so realistic that most viewers have no idea it's AI. And if video marketing is important to your business (which it is for most businesses in 2024), this is the most efficient way to create consistent, professional content. Would you like to see some examples from your industry?

"I need to think about it"
→ Absolutely, take your time! Quick question though - is there something specific you're unsure about that I could help clarify? Sometimes talking through concerns helps with the decision. Also, I should mention that our production schedule fills up quickly, especially during busy seasons. If you're seriously considering it, booking a call at least reserves your spot while you decide.

"Can I just do this myself?"
→ You technically can, but consider the time investment: learning the tools, writing scripts, recording, editing, adding captions... most business owners find it takes 20-30 hours per week to create consistent video content. Our clients hire us because their time is better spent running their business and serving clients. We handle all the heavy lifting so you can focus on what you do best.

"I've had bad experiences with video agencies"
→ I'm sorry to hear that! Unfortunately, not all agencies deliver quality work. What sets us apart is our done-for-you approach with guaranteed turnarounds, clear communication through your client portal, and included revisions to ensure you're happy. We also show you a sample video for approval before producing all 30. You're never left guessing about progress or quality.

"What if I don't like the videos?"
→ Great question! We've built in safeguards:
1. You approve your spokesperson before production
2. You get a sample video before we create all 30
3. 2 revision rounds are included
4. We work until you're satisfied
In years of business, we've never had a client unhappy with their final delivery. We're committed to your success.

"I want to see results first"
→ I understand wanting proof before investing. Here's what I can share: the average engagement rate for our clients' AI spokesperson videos is 3-5x higher than static posts. Many clients report leads coming in within the first week of posting. The real question is - can you afford NOT to be creating video content when your competitors already are?
