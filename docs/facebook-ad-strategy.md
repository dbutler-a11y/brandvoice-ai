## Strategic Framework (Hormozi x Cardone x Brunson)

### Alex Hormozi Principles
- **Lead with the transformation**, not the product
- **Stack value** until the offer is a "no-brainer"
- **Use specific numbers** (not "lots of videos" → "30 videos in 7 days")
- **Remove risk** with guarantees and proof
- **Grand Slam Offer formula**: Dream Outcome + Perceived Likelihood + Time Delay + Effort/Sacrifice

### Grant Cardone Principles
- **10X energy** - bold, confident claims
- **Urgency without being sleazy** - opportunity cost framing
- **Attack the status quo** - "Stop doing X"
- **Massive action** messaging

### Russell Brunson Principles
- **Hook → Story → Offer** framework
- **Problem-Agitate-Solution** structure
- **Before/After transformation** visuals
- **Curiosity gaps** to drive clicks
- **"Secret" or "discovery"** framing

## Ad Creative Concepts

### CONCEPT 1: "The Camera Shy Entrepreneur" (Launch Kit - $1,497)
**Target**: Business owners who hate being on camera

**HOOK** (0-3 sec):
> "I used to hide from my own marketing..."

**STORY/VALUE** (3-15 sec):
> "Every competitor was on video. I wasn't. Not because I didn't want to grow—I just couldn't stand filming myself. Then I discovered AI spokespersons. Now I have 30 professional videos and I've never touched a camera."

**CTA** (15-20 sec):
> "Link in bio. Get your first 30 videos in 7 days. No filming required."

**Visual Direction**: Professional person at desk, looking frustrated at camera setup → transition to watching AI videos on laptop, smiling

---

### CONCEPT 2: "The Math Problem" (Content Engine - $997/mo)
**Target**: Business owners doing the math on content costs

**HOOK** (0-3 sec):
> "Let me show you why you're overpaying for content..."

**STORY/VALUE** (3-15 sec):
> "A videographer: $500 per video. An editor: $200 per video. 30 videos a month? That's $21,000. Or... you pay us $997 and get all 30 done-for-you. Same quality. 95% less cost. The math isn't hard."

**CTA** (15-20 sec):
> "Stop overpaying. Link below."

**Visual Direction**: Calculator/numbers appearing on screen, crossing out expensive totals, revealing the $997 price

---

### CONCEPT 3: "The Consistency Killer" (Content Engine - $997/mo)
**Target**: Inconsistent posters

**HOOK** (0-3 sec):
> "Your followers forgot you exist."

**STORY/VALUE** (3-15 sec):
> "You posted once last month. Maybe twice. Your competitors? They're showing up every single day. Not because they have more time—they have a content engine. 30 videos delivered monthly. Just download and post. Your audience never forgets you again."

**CTA** (15-20 sec):
> "Become unforgettable. Link in bio."

**Visual Direction**: Empty social feed → feed filling up with consistent video content

---

### CONCEPT 4: "The 7-Day Transformation" (Launch Kit - $1,497)
**Target**: People who want fast results

**HOOK** (0-3 sec):
> "7 days from now, you could have 30 videos ready to post."

**STORY/VALUE** (3-15 sec):
> "Not someday. Not next quarter. 7 days. A custom AI spokesperson that looks and sounds professional. 30 scripts written for your business. 30 videos edited and ready. All you do is post. This is what happens when you stop trying to do everything yourself."

**CTA** (15-20 sec):
> "Your 7-day transformation starts now. Link below."

**Visual Direction**: Calendar flipping through 7 days, each day showing more completed videos

**Target**: Businesses spending on talent

**HOOK** (0-3 sec):
> "Stop hiring actors for your videos."

**STORY/VALUE** (3-15 sec):
> "Actors cost thousands. They're unavailable when you need them. They require scripts, teleprompters, retakes. Your AI spokesperson? Available 24/7. Unlimited retakes. One-time cost. Speaks 29 languages. Never asks for a raise."

**CTA** (15-20 sec):
> "Meet your new spokesperson. Link in bio."

**Visual Direction**: Frustrated director on set → clean AI spokesperson delivering perfect take

### CONCEPT 6: "The Brand Starter Reality Check" (Brand Starter - $497)
**Target**: New businesses with no brand

**HOOK** (0-3 sec):
> "Your brand looks like a hobby, not a business."

**STORY/VALUE** (3-15 sec):
> "No logo. Inconsistent colors. Generic templates. Customers notice. They scroll past. For $497, you get a complete brand identity: logo, colors, website, 30 days of content, and a bot that handles inquiries. Stop looking amateur."

**CTA** (15-20 sec):
> "Look like a real business. Link below."

**Target**: Established brands wanting to dominate

**HOOK** (0-3 sec):
> "Your competitors are about to wonder how you're everywhere."

**STORY/VALUE** (3-15 sec):
> "60+ videos a month. 3 different AI avatars. 3 custom voices. Multi-language versions. Full funnel content from awareness to conversion. This isn't a content strategy—this is market domination. While they post once a week, you post twice a day."

**CTA** (15-20 sec):
> "Dominate your market. Book a call."

**Visual Direction**: Social feeds flooding with branded content, competitors looking confused

**Target**: Busy entrepreneurs

**HOOK** (0-3 sec):
> "How many hours did you waste on content last month?"

**STORY/VALUE** (3-15 sec):
> "Filming. Editing. Writing captions. Posting. Responding. That's 40+ hours you could've spent closing deals, serving clients, or actually living your life. We do all of it for you. You get the content. We do the work. Time back in your pocket."

**CTA** (15-20 sec):
> "Get your time back. Link in bio."

**Visual Direction**: Clock spinning, person stressed → clock stops, person relaxed reviewing delivered content

**HOOK** (0-3 sec):
> "I didn't believe it either..."

**STORY/VALUE** (3-15 sec):
> "AI videos that look real? Sounded too good. Then I saw the samples. Real businesses. Real results. Med spas booking more appointments. Coaches filling programs. Real estate agents closing deals. All from AI spokesperson videos they didn't have to film."

**CTA** (15-20 sec):
> "See the samples yourself. Link below."

**Visual Direction**: Testimonial-style with quick cuts of different business types succeeding

**Target**: Price-conscious new businesses

**HOOK** (0-3 sec):

**STORY/VALUE** (3-15 sec):
> "Logo design alone costs $500-2000. Website design? $3000+. Social content? Another $1000/month. Or... $497 one-time and you get everything: brand identity, custom website, 30 days of content, automated responses. This isn't a deal—it's a no-brainer."

**CTA** (15-20 sec):
> "Grab it before we raise the price. Link in bio."

**Visual Direction**: Price tags appearing and getting crossed out, $497 glowing
