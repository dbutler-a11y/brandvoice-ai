# -----------------------------------------
# VERSION 1.4 — DFY AI SPOKESPERSON AGENCY
### "Your Own AI Spokesperson + 30 Days of Content — Done For You in 7 Days"
### Optimized for Fast Launch, Viral Content, Facebook Ad Deliverables, and On-Site Voice Preview (ElevenLabs)
# -----------------------------------------

**Version:** 1.4
**Model:** Done-For-You (DFY) with Client Portal
**Website:** AI Spokesperson Studio (Existing Project Enhancement)
**Purpose:** Fastest path to revenue using existing AI tools (VidBuzz, HeyGen, ElevenLabs, etc.), with an on-site voice preview tool as part of MVP, while internal full automation remains Phase 2.

---

## 1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW

This business launches immediately as a **DFY AI Spokesperson Agency**.

### Key characteristics:

- **Clients DO log in** to their portal to:
  - View project status
  - Download completed videos and assets
  - Access their scripts
  - Track delivery progress
- **Clients do NOT** manage production or make creative decisions in the platform
- You deliver:
  - A custom AI spokesperson
  - 30 days of short-form video content
  - Optional Facebook ad creative add-on
- All production is initially done using external tools:
  - **VidBuzz**
  - **HeyGen**
  - **KIE / Kling**
  - **ElevenLabs**
  - **Captions.ai / Veed.io / CapCut / AutoCaption**
- You now ALSO have:
  - An **on-site voice preview UI** that lets prospects preview and select voice tones, powered by **ElevenLabs API**.

Full internal automation (integrated pipelines, etc.) is still a **Phase 2** goal, **not required to launch**.
